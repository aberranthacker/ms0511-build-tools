# Elektronika MS 0511 Build Tools
Helper scripts I wrote during the development of the [Chibi Akuma(s)](https://github.com/aberranthacker/chibiakumas) game.
I later used these scripts in other projects, which led to the extraction of the `build_tools` directory,
and adding it to projects as a Git sub-module.

## To add to a project as sub-module execute:
```sh
git submodule add git@github.com:aberranthacker/ms0511-build-tools.git build_tools/
```

## The repository also includes executables for following software:
* lzsa - https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa
* lzsa3 - https://github.com/imachug/lzsa3
